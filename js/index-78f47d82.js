The way people in China do sports is changing a lot because of the market. These mechanisms include the CBA league becoming more professional, athletes starting their own brands, and more money going into training programs for young athletes. However, in this big change of how sports are organized and how the market is explored, one important group has not been heard—the athletes themselves. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Most existing research has used a big-picture economic, management, or policy analysis to look at the sports industry&#39;s market size, how leagues work, or changes to how institutions are run. Nevertheless, there hasn&#39;t been much research on how these changes actually affect athletes&#39; careers, values, and life choices. When Xiaosheng Liu talks about the differences in training philosophies between China and other countries, when Zhaoxu Zhang talks about China&#39;s youth basketball development after experiencing the NCAA system, when Siling Yi talks about the balance between the state-led system and university education, and when Wenjing Bi talks about the challenges to making gymnastics a professional sport, these individual stories offer the most valuable clues to understanding the true landscape of China&#39;s sports professionalization. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> The goal of this study is to look at more than just the big picture and statistics. We do this by talking to athletes. We ask them about what it&#39;s like for them to compete against other athletes and to be on a team. We also ask them about what it&#39;s like to be an athlete in the United States. We want to answer these questions: As the focus changed from winning for the country to focusing on the value of the market, how did athletes understand and deal with these changing roles? This study looks at how opportunities and risks related to commercialization affect career decisions and post-retirement transitions. The subjects&#39; stories include their personal experiences and the bigger picture of China&#39;s efforts in professional sports and its ability to achieve long-lasting, people-focused growth. </p></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><h2 class="section-title" data-v-469177b8>Athletes Case-Analysis</h2><div class="case-content" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-images" data-v-469177b8></div><div class="case-text" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title" data-v-469177b8>Xiaosheng Liu (Men’s 400meters track）</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8> The transition from &quot;Seeking a Way Out&quot; to &quot;Seeking Development&quot;—an awakening to value and the establishment of structure. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> A distinguished competitor in the Chinese men&#39;s 400-meter track and field events, he secured triumph at the 2008 IAAF Osaka Grand Prix, marking the second instance in which a Chinese athlete, subsequent to Xiang Liu, has prevailed in this competition. Additionally, he secured the 400-meter title at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships, achieving a personal best of 45.79 seconds. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> In the Chinese athletic system, there is a discrepancy between the perception of athletes and the ideal function of coaching staff. Many athletes think that their coaches do not adequately support their training regimens; rather, they believe that the coaches should be providing more guidance. Consequently, when individuals engage in international travel, their training is driven by their own volition rather than external demands, resulting in divergent outcomes. Due to such a reason, I engaged in discourse with them regarding the rationale behind their training methodology. This phenomenon can be likened to culinary arts.  For example, a Guangdong person and a Sichuan person can both make meals, but one must understand the methods employed by each—whether one prefers spicy or light flavors. There is no inherent superiority; each approach is distinct. The crux of the matter lies in one&#39;s ability to assimilate the information and transform it into a beneficial asset.&quot;  said Xiaosheng Liu. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Perspective: Xiaosheng Liu’s trajectory exemplifies the transformation in the ethos of Chinese athletes. His initial involvement in track and field was driven by a common rationale among athletes seeking to alter their circumstances through athletic aptitude. However, as his career progressed, he transitioned from passive acceptance to active creation. It is acknowledged that the success of elite athletes is contingent upon the transition from a state of compliance, characterized by the perception that success is predetermined and external, to a state of co-creation, wherein success is viewed as a collaborative effort between the athlete and external factors. This transformation signifies not only the advancement of training methodologies but also the substantiation and ascent of individual athlete value within the system. </p></div></div></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-content" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-text" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title" data-v-469177b8>Zhaoxu Zhang (Basketball)</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8> The concept of &quot;system bridge-builder&quot; and its application in cultivating professional awareness between cultures. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> He used to play for the Chinese men&#39;s national basketball team and represented China at the 2012 London Olympics. He was well-known for both his height and defensive prowess, and he also excelled at rebounding and blocking shots. Zhang&#39;s professional career included participation in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I, followed by a significant tenure with the Shanghai Sharks in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> The subject reported that the trip to the United States was self-planned. As previously mentioned, determining the optimal training location, selecting the appropriate educational institution for the subsequent academic period, establishing attainable objectives, and implementing prompt modifications represent a formidable challenge. This phenomenon can be attributed to the historical practice of delegating such tasks to external entities. My personal experience, which I gained growing up in Yantai, Shandong, further substantiates this claim. I attended the Yantai Sports School and subsequently joined the Shandong Youth Team, where my notable performance earned me a position on the Shandong first team. The prevailing circumstances did not offer significant opportunities for transformation.&quot;  Zhaoxu Zhang. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Perspective: Zhaoxu Zhang&#39;s distinctive contribution lies in his firsthand experience with two starkly different development systems in China and the U.S. He transcends simplistic comparisons of &quot;which is better,&quot; revealing that the core of professionalization is cultivating athletes&#39; &quot;self-direction&quot; and &quot;planning and decision-making&quot; abilities. He underwent a transformation, transitioning from a passive executor under China&#39;s &quot;nanny-style&quot; management to a proactive decision-maker who was compelled to chart his course within the American environment. This journey underscores the notion that professionalization encompasses more than merely the commercial operation of leagues; it reveals an investment in athletes&#39; independent personalities and their long-term development capabilities. </p></div><div class="case-images" data-v-469177b8></div></div></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-content" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-images" data-v-469177b8></div><div class="case-text" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title" data-v-469177b8> Wenjing Bi (Gymnastic）</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8> The implications of the nation system on individual sacrifice and silent costs. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> She was a former member of the Chinese women&#39;s gymnastics team, specializing in the uneven bars. Her defining moment occurred at the 1998 Gymnastics World Cup, where she secured the gold medal in the uneven bars event. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) designated the &quot;Bi Wenjing Turn&quot; in her honor, thereby acknowledging her instrumental role in the sport&#39;s advancement. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> &quot;In terms of what to look out for in speech, I believe it primarily stems from experience—observing successive waves of athletes emerge, achieve success, and eventually retire. However, the inquiry posed prompts further reflection. A comparison of the nation system with independently managed athletes, such as those in tennis (e.g., Na Li), reveals that athletes under the nation system experience disadvantages in several key areas: physical rehabilitation, nutrition, team coordination, and psychological counseling. These disparities are in contrast to the support received by teams managing independently managed tennis players. The attainment of favorable outcomes by athletes is largely contingent upon fortuitous circumstances. Wenjing Bi <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Perspective: In her narrative, Wenjing Bi utilizes powerful physical memories to unveil the often-overlooked individual sacrifices that have contributed to the nation&#39;s significant achievements. Her depiction of &quot;blood-soaked&quot; palms offers a vivid illustration of the system&#39;s profound impact on individuals. A subsequent examination of this model indicates its propensity to result in the &quot;standardization&quot; of athlete development and the concomitant absence of &quot;personalized support.&quot; This phenomenon reflects a harsh reality: within the nation system, which is constrained by limited resources, the success of an athlete is to a certain extent &quot;entirely up to fate.&quot; That is to say, an athlete&#39;s success is contingent upon fortuitously encountered coaching resources and the athlete&#39;s own physical endurance. </p></div></div></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-content" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-text" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title" data-v-469177b8>Siling Yi (Air rifle event)</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8>  Education is posited as a crucial conduit to the external world under the context of the nation system. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> A renowned Chinese female shooter, she claimed the gold medal in the women&#39;s 10m air rifle event at the 2012 London Olympics, securing China&#39;s first gold medal of those Games. Moreover, she has attained the distinction of being a World Championships champion and a world record holder, having accomplished the Grand Slam in this discipline. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> &quot;Competitive sports have been shown to have a significant impact on athletes&#39; mental health, often resulting in emotional turbulence. Attendance at university provided a respite from the pressures of competition. The ability to adapt to different environments and to engage in problem-solving in those environments has also been instrumental in facilitating a more effective mental adjustment. In my estimation, the process of acquiring knowledge serves as a medium for the release of psychological tension and the facilitation of self-regulation. Indeed, it must be acknowledged that not all individuals possess the innate ability to attain the pinnacle of athletic success, such as that achieved by Olympic champions. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that not all individuals have the capacity to achieve the highest echelon of success within their respective domains. The majority of individuals ultimately reintegrate into mainstream society, necessitating the development of competencies beyond the realm of sports to facilitate a comprehensive reinterpretation of self.&quot; Siling Yi is the subject of this text. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Perspective: Siling Yi expounds on the profound significance of higher education, illustrating its role in transcending the mere symbolism of a diploma within the unforgiving and competitive realm of competitive sports. For the subject, the university campus functions as a &quot;psychological buffer zone&quot; from the high-pressure demands of athletic life, a rare &quot;pure social circle&quot; amid intense peer competition, and a &quot;simulation training ground&quot; where she rehearses societal roles and builds diverse identities. Through her actions, she demonstrates that education is not the enemy of training; rather, it is a &quot;strategic supply line&quot; for athletes to maintain mental health and achieve sustainable development. </p></div><div class="case-images" data-v-469177b8></div></div></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-content-group" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title" data-v-469177b8>Zhuocheng Yu (Diving), Dixi Wu (Badminton), Xiaoyan Li (Gymnastic)</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8> A group interview with Zhuocheng Yu, Dixi Wu, and Xiaoyan Li. The structural challenges and generational reflections on post-retirement transition, as outlined in the texts &quot;Collective Identity&quot; and &quot;Individual Rebirth.&quot; <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Zhuocheng Yu, a former member of China&#39;s diving team, is an exemplar of this phenomenon. He was awarded a silver medal in the men&#39;s 3-meter springboard at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and subsequently claimed a gold medal at the 1993 World Cup. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Dixi Wu played a pivotal role as a member of China&#39;s women&#39;s doubles badminton team during the 1980s, contributing significantly to the team&#39;s success on the international stage. In collaboration with Ying Lin, she achieved victory in the 1983 All England and World Championships women&#39;s doubles categories and played a pivotal role in China&#39;s triumphant 1984 Uber Cup win. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Xiaoyan Li achieved numerous accolades with China&#39;s artistic gymnastics team during the 1970s and 1980s, winning multiple international titles in women&#39;s pairs all-around and individual events. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Upon retirement, a sense of liberation was experienced, accompanied by a sense of naivete. In the past, there was no organization specifically designed to provide counsel and guidance to retired athletes. In the contemporary era, there was a paucity of knowledge regarding the external world beyond athletics. Following the disengagement from the collective, the subsequent utilization of our residual potential was contingent upon our own efforts,&quot; said Dixi Wu. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> &quot;However, the contemporary context is distinct. Extensive work has been conducted on career planning... These measures are intended to assist athletes in establishing the foundation for their future success during their training, thereby enhancing their employability and social integration skills. - Zhuocheng Yu <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Perspective: This discourse, which is held between veteran athletes and administrators, provides a macro-level analysis of the &quot;push&quot; from the state-led system and the &quot;cliff-edge sensation&quot; experienced upon retirement. It is acknowledged that the system is remarkably effective in its concentration of resources and shaping of &quot;collective identity.&quot; Nevertheless, Dixi Wu&#39;s disconcerting metaphor of &quot;emerging from prison&quot; underscores a critical structural deficit in the cultivation of athletes&#39; social survival skills. Their reflections signify progress, marked by a shift from the older generation&#39;s resignation to &quot;figuring things out on their own&quot; to the new generation&#39;s systematic promotion of athlete career planning. This evolution is indicative of the system&#39;s broader awakening and commitment to holistic development. </p><div class="case-images-row" data-v-469177b8></div></div></div><div class="case-analysis-section" data-v-469177b8><div class="case-content-group" data-v-469177b8><h3 class="case-title center" data-v-469177b8>summary</h3><p class="case-paragraph" data-v-469177b8> Over past decades, China has become well-known around the world for its sports teams. They have won many games and competitions. The &quot;national system&quot; is the key to implementing the &quot;Olympic Glory&quot; strategy. It has been an important way for the academic community to understand China&#39;s ideas about sports management. Researchers have studied where the system came from, what its strengths are, and what its challenges are. Researchers have studied these things in different ways. Some look at the whole system. Some look at history. Some look at how well policies work. Yet, there&#39;s a key point missing from this discussion. In the current era of major changes in how sports are organized, it is important to consider the mental experiences and professional progress of the athletes, who are the primary focus of sports. What do the personal stories tell us about the deep reasons for and future of Chinese sports? <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> The Chinese sports industry is changing a lot right now. The government has always played a big role in supporting elite athletes. However, a combination of professionalization and marketization, along with national policies that encourage combining sports with education, is changing the way sports are developed. This change is shown by a few important developments. For example, well-known athletes like Xiaosheng Liu and Zhaoxu Zhang have trained in other countries. Additionally, respected world champions like Siling Yi and Wenjing Bi have shared their thoughts on cultural education and changing careers. Experienced athletes like Zhuocheng Yu and Dixi Wu have also shared their ideas on how organizations can improve and grow. These observations suggest that there have been significant changes in the environment where Chinese athletes grow up, the values they believe in, and how they develop. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> Therefore, an analysis that only looks at the institutional level may not capture the complexities of this transformative process. The evolution of the sports system is shown in the specific moments that change the lives of many people. This study looks at how the collectivist ethos created under the state-led system and the resultant awakening of individual value during the process of professionalization interact. This study looks at how athletes go from focusing on &quot;winning glory for the nation&quot; to pursuing &quot;self-realization&quot; (understanding oneself) in a world where there are many different values. We should ask them how they plan to help students find good jobs. We want to know how they will go from &quot;system-based placement&quot; to &quot;market-driven exploration.&quot; The answers to these questions are very important for understanding the human aspect of China&#39;s sports reform. They can also help us predict what will happen in the future. <br data-v-469177b8><br data-v-469177b8> The goal of this study is to tell stories that big institutions don&#39;t usually share. To do this, we will talk to five athletes (or groups) from different generations and sports. The goal of this study is to understand the hidden details, true feelings, and active choices in China&#39;s sports evolution from the &quot;national system&quot; to different explorations by looking at the small histories of individual lives. The goal of this study is twofold. First, we want to record the history of sports as told by the athletes who experienced it. Second, we want to learn more about how big changes in society and in sports affect the development of individual athletes by listening to their stories. The goal of this study is to provide insights based on real-life experiences. This will help create a more people-centered and sustainable future for Chinese sports. </p></div></div>',8)])])}],["__scopeId","data-v-469177b8"]]);export{s as default};

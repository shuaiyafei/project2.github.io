If something puzzles me, I always want to figure out “why”. This habit probably started from a &quot;puzzle&quot; that my body presented to me. During my junior high school years, I suffered from a headache that lasted for nearly two years and no one could figure out why. I became a frequent visitor to the hospital. Those days of struggling in doctors&#39; offices and facing various medical tests made me realize for the first time that we actually know very little about the body we are born with. And this confusion as a &quot;patient&quot; sparked my primitive curiosity about how life works and where diseases come from. </p></div></div><div class="about-image" data-v-68ce1bde><img loading="lazy" src="/home/hero.webp" alt="Gavin" data-v-68ce1bde></div></div>',1)])])}],["__scopeId","data-v-68ce1bde"]]);export{i as default};

In those days of solitude, I had no accompaniment but a brand-new set of Harry Potter books, which I finished reading all seven volumes in just three days.

Every noon, a sharp pricking and a regularly throbbing pain would punctually appear in my head. In order to relieve it, I tried pounding on myself, but the only effective remedy was taking ibuprofen. What&#39;s worse, I felt extremely anxious about the long list of side effects on the bottle each time I drank the medicine.

The most desperate moment came when a doctor suspected that I might have meningitis and suggested a spinal tap to extract cerebrospinal fluid for confirmation. As I waited for the results in the hospital room, I saw my parents cry in front of me for the first time.

This experience left me with a great confusion: Why can humans explore distant galaxies, but often feel powerless when dealing with their own healthy problems?

When the&quot;positive” result of nucleic acid test appeared before me, the diseases and symptoms written in books suddenly connected with a real, modern public health event that was affecting millions of people.

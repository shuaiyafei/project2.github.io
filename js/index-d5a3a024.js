I began to wonder: if we can design tools to &quot;turn off&quot; key genes in viruses, can we use similar, or even more powerful, methods to &quot;correct&quot; the faulty genes that cause human diseases? This possibility of extending the technological logic from &quot;fighting external threats&quot; to &quot;repairing the self&quot; sparked a strong desire in me to explore gene-editing technologies. This was no longer just curiosity about a phenomenon, but a systematic pursuit of knowledge about the principles, potential, and boundaries of a transformative technology. </p></section><section class="content-section" data-v-f17ea776><h2 class="section-title" data-v-f17ea776>Part One: EPQ Research Mapping Knowledge Through Literature</h2><div class="section-content" data-v-f17ea776><p class="section-text" data-v-f17ea776> Therefore, during high school, I decided to undertake a deep, self-driven investigation into the CRISPR-Cas gene-editing system. My first attempt was to complete a comprehensive EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) research paper, aimed at mapping out the contours of this technology from its roots. This was not an experimental report, but an independent academic expedition through a sea of literature, honing my ability to synthesize complex information, construct logical frameworks, and form independent viewpoints. </p><div class="content-images" data-v-f17ea776><div class="image-box" data-v-f17ea776><img src="/expedition/1.webp" alt="EPQ Research" data-v-f17ea776></div><div class="image-box" data-v-f17ea776><img src="/expedition/2.webp" alt="Gene Editing Details" data-v-f17ea776></div></div></div><p class="section-footer" data-v-f17ea776> To help visualize the key concepts I explored, I created comparison matrices and conceptual diagrams.

Most gene-editing strategies operate by introducing a double-strand break (DSB) and then relying on endogenous repair pathways. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) often produces small insertions/deletions that knock out gene function, while homology-directed repair (HDR) can use a donor template to install precise substitutions or insertions. Before CRISPR dominated the field, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) represented earlier generations of programmable nucleases. Although effective, they typically require complex protein engineering, can be time-consuming to redesign for each target, and are often associated with higher cost and limited flexibility—factors that accelerated the search for more scalable solutions. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)–Cas systems revolutionized gene editing by offering an RNA-guided, highly reprogrammable platform derived from bacterial adaptive immunity. In bacteria, CRISPR arrays store “spacer” sequences from past invaders; these are transcribed into CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide Cas proteins to complementary nucleic-acid targets for interference. Today, CRISPR–Cas systems are commonly grouped into two major classes with multiple types and subtypes. A key practical distinction is that Class 1 systems rely on multi-protein effector complexes, whereas Class 2 systems use a single large effector nuclease—making Class 2 especially convenient for engineering and delivery. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> This article focuses on four widely used Class 2 effectors—Cas9, dCas9, Cas12a, and Cas13a—and explains how their nuclease architectures and guide-RNA designs determine what they can do (DNA cutting, RNA cutting, or gene regulation without cutting). It also outlines major applications across genome editing, transcriptional control, and diagnostics, while evaluating real-world constraints such as off-target activity, DNA-damage-related cellular responses, delivery bottlenecks, and broader bioethical concerns about heritable change and governance. </p><div class="paper-image-wrapper" data-v-f17ea776><p class="figure-caption" data-v-f17ea776>Table1.

The “method” therefore lies in how the content is organized and compared across CRISPR platforms. First, it establishes foundational concepts for gene editing—DSB formation, NHEJ vs HDR outcomes, and why programmable nucleases are central to targeted genetic modification. It then frames CRISPR–Cas as a bacterial immune mechanism with three broad functional stages: spacer acquisition, crRNA biogenesis, and interference. With this framework in place, the paper narrows its scope to four representative Class 2 systems (Cas9, dCas9, Cas12a, Cas13a) and analyzes each using a consistent set of dimensions: <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Core components and structural domains: For each nuclease, the paper describes domain architecture (e.g., HNH/RuvC in Cas9; HEPN domains in Cas13a), guide RNA elements (crRNA, tracrRNA, or sgRNA), and accessory requirements. This provides a mechanistic basis for understanding why some systems cut DNA, some cut RNA, and some bind without cutting. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Target-recognition rules and cleavage mechanisms: The review compares DNA-targeting systems that require a PAM sequence (Cas9, Cas12a) with RNA-targeting systems that use PFS-like constraints (Cas13a). It also contrasts canonical “cis-cleavage” of the intended target with collateral behaviors (notably Cas12a/Cas13a trans-cleavage in certain states), and explains how these properties enable applications beyond editing. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Applications: The article groups applications into genome editing, transcriptional regulation (especially with dCas9), and molecular diagnostics (e.g., Cas13a-based detection strategies). <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Limitations and improvement strategies: Safety risks (off-targets, apoptosis, chromosomal abnormalities), efficiency constraints (delivery systems, expression format), and mitigation strategies (high-fidelity Cas variants, sgRNA optimization, RNP delivery) are reviewed in an applied manner. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> By using this comparison-first structure, the paper turns a diverse CRISPR landscape into a coherent map: “what it is,” “how it works,” “what it’s used for,” and “what still limits it.” </p></div><h2 class="scroll-title" style="margin-top:200px;" data-v-f17ea776>Discussion</h2><div class="scroll-content" style="margin-bottom:200px;" data-v-f17ea776><p class="paper-text" data-v-f17ea776> A major takeaway from comparing Cas9, dCas9, Cas12a, and Cas13a is that small mechanistic differences create very different “tool profiles.” Cas9 remains the most widely used DNA editor because sgRNA programmability and PAM-based targeting make it broadly deployable for knock-out/knock-in workflows through NHEJ/HDR. However, its strengths are closely tied to its main weaknesses: DSB formation can trigger DNA-damage responses (including p53-associated pathways in some contexts), and imperfect guide specificity can yield off-target cuts that introduce unwanted mutations or large genomic rearrangements. These risks scale with delivery format, expression duration, and the tolerance of the nuclease for guide–target mismatches. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> dCas9 demonstrates how “editing” can extend beyond cutting. By inactivating Cas9’s cleavage domains while preserving guide-directed binding, dCas9 becomes a programmable DNA-binding scaffold for CRISPRi/CRISPRa, epigenetic modification, or live-cell imaging. This shift is important in safety discussions: when regulation is sufficient (rather than permanent genome change), dCas9-based control may reduce DSB-related hazards while still enabling meaningful biological intervention. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Cas12a expands the DNA-editing toolkit with distinct PAM preferences (often T-rich), a different cleavage pattern, and the practical advantage that it can process crRNA arrays more naturally for multiplex targeting. Cas13a broadens CRISPR beyond DNA by enabling RNA targeting, which is attractive for applications where transient, reversible control is preferred, and for diagnostics where collateral cleavage can amplify signal. Yet collateral activity also highlights a design tradeoff: mechanisms useful for detection must be carefully controlled in therapeutic contexts to avoid unintended RNA degradation. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> Across all systems, the paper emphasizes that delivery is a central bottleneck affecting efficiency and safety. Viral vectors, electroporation-based methods, and nanomaterial delivery each impose different constraints on payload size, tissue targeting, expression duration, and off-target risk. The discussion therefore connects molecular-level risks (off-target, chromosomal abnormalities) to system-level solutions (high-fidelity Cas variants, improved sgRNA design, RNP delivery, and governance/ethics frameworks). In this sense, the “best” CRISPR system is context-dependent: it depends on whether the priority is precision editing, scalable multiplexing, transient regulation, or field-deployable detection. </p></div></div></section><p class="intro-desc" data-v-f17ea776> The process of completing this paper was an intellectual tempering for me.

I was eager to see how the sophisticated techniques I read about in papers were implemented step-by-step in the lab. The opportunity came during a summer program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). This time, my focus shifted from a grand technological panorama to a specific, minute experimental step. <br data-v-f17ea776><br data-v-f17ea776> During the molecular cloning in the earlier iGEM project, heat shock transformation (a key step for introducing foreign plasmids into E. coli) was a routine procedure.

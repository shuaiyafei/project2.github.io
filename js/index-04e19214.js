At an Operation Smile China volunteer site for cleft lip and palate support, I first recognized the needs of the community being served and was deeply touched by the compassionate dedication of the nonprofit staff, including medical professionals and volunteers. I also observed another distinct group: representatives from various companies. Some were examining donated supplies, others were helping with outreach efforts, and still others were leading employee families through interactive sessions. That scene raised an urgent question in my mind: What does the participation of these companies truly signify? <br data-v-2a1686de> Is it only linked to donating money and materials, or can it drive deeper, systemic change? Can their involvement assist public welfare organizations such as Operation Smile China in becoming stronger and more sustainable? If so, how can such collaboration achieve the maximum possible impact? These emerging questions guided me to define my research focus: exploring how corporate involvement in public welfare initiatives fosters the healthy development of nonprofit organizations. I am keen to seek concrete answers via systematic inquiry and to commence this exploration by participating in the China Thinks Big (CTB) innovation research project </p></div><div class="research-image" style="padding:0;" data-v-2a1686de><img loading="lazy" src="/smile/new/1.webp" alt="Businesses Joining Hands" data-v-2a1686de></div></div></div><div class="research-section top" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-container" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-image" style="padding:0;" data-v-2a1686de><img loading="lazy" src="/smile/new/2.webp" alt="Volunteer Activity" data-v-2a1686de></div><div class="research-text" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-title" data-v-2a1686de>II. How I Pursued Answers—Design of a Mixed-Methods Approach</p><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> To comprehensively answer the questions, I decided to adopt a “mixed-methods” approach, collecting both broad quantitative data and in-depth qualitative stories. <br data-v-2a1686de> First, questionnaire surveys were conducted to gather diverse opinions. Two sets of questionnaires were designed, targeting businesses and the general public separately. Following a phase of distribution and collection, I eventually secured 204 valid business questionnaires (spanning various industries like finance, manufacturing, and technology) and 454 valid public questionnaires. Before analysis, I employed statistical methods to examine the reliability and validity of the questionnaires, ensuring the data was robust and trustworthy. <br data-v-2a1686de> Second, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore the underlying logic.Finally, data analysis and integration. I employed SPSS software to conduct statistical analysis on the questionnaire data, including correlation and regression analyses, to examine variable relationships. At the same time, I compared and verified the vivid insights from interviews with statistical data, aiming to reconstruct a three-dimensional, authentic picture of business-public welfare collaboration. </p></div></div></div><div class="research-section" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-title" data-v-2a1686de>III. Finding 1: The Rational Choice of Businesses—What Do They Truly Value?</p><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> To address these questions in a comprehensive manner, I adopted a mixed-methods research approach, combining large-scale quantitative data with in-depth qualitative narratives. <br data-v-2a1686de><br data-v-2a1686de> Firstly, I designed and distributed two separate questionnaires targeting corporate entities and the general public respectively. After a period of collection and validation, I obtained 204 valid responses from the businesses across various fields—including finance, manufacturing, and technology—as well as 454 valid responses from the public. Prior to analysis, I conducted reliability and validity tests to ensure the robustness and credibility of the data. </p><div class="research-container" style="padding-top:40px;" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-text" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> Then, to move beyond the numbers and understand the underlying “why,” I carried out in-depth interviews with three key stakeholders: a representative from Allianz Group, a long-term supporter of the initiative; the founder of the maternal and infant brand William&amp;Beta, which engages through innovative partnership models; and the director of Operation Smile China. Each nearly hour-long conversation provided rich, firsthand insights into the motivations, challenges, and tangible outcomes of cross-sector collaboration. <br data-v-2a1686de> Finally, I integrated both datasets to form a multidimensional understanding. Using SPSS, I performed statistical analyses—including correlation and regression tests—to identify key patterns and relationships within the survey data. These quantitative findings were then cross-referenced with themes and narratives from the interviews, allowing me to construct a more complete and nuanced picture of how corporate participation influences the development and sustainability of public welfare organizations. </p></div><div class="research-image" style="padding:0;" data-v-2a1686de><img loading="lazy" src="/smile/new/3.webp" alt="Research Approach" data-v-2a1686de></div></div></div><div class="research-section top" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-container" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-image" style="padding:0;" data-v-2a1686de><img loading="lazy" src="/smile/new/4.webp" alt="Rational Choice" data-v-2a1686de></div><div class="research-text" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-title" data-v-2a1686de>IV. Finding 2: The Complex Mindset of the Public—Coexistence of Support, Expectation, and Scrutiny</p><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> In contrast to the largely rational calculations of businesses, public attitudes toward corporate social engagement are more layered and nuanced, defined by a dual reality of high expectation and high vigilance. <br data-v-2a1686de> On the one hand, public support is not only widespread but also action-oriented. Over 60% of survey respondents agree that corporate involvement can enhance the transparency and credibility of charitable projects. More tellingly, with an average score close to 4 on a Likert scale, the data indicate that consumers genuinely favor products or services from companies that actively participate in public welfare—evidence that the public is willing to support corporate goodwill through their purchasing decisions. <br data-v-2a1686de> On the other hand, public skepticism remains steady and significant. Around a quarter of respondents expressed direct doubt regarding corporate motives, describing such initiatives as potential “publicity stunts” or examples of “excessive commercialization.” Furthermore, a strong majority (scoring as high as 3.896 on average) stated they would readily boycott a company found to be involved in misconduct within a charitable project. In effect, the public serves as the most extensive and influential watchdog over corporate philanthropic behavior. Correlation analysis further underscores that the public’s awareness and attention to social causes, as well as their pre-existing trust and evaluation of a business, are key factors shaping their perceptions of corporate intent in public welfare engagements. </p></div></div></div><div class="research-section" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-title" data-v-2a1686de>V.

Conclusion and Outlook: Reflections on Goodwill and Efficacy</p><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> Looking back on the entire research journey, I have distilled my findings and reflections into three core insights: <br data-v-2a1686de> 1.Collaboration Endures When Motives Are Aligned <br data-v-2a1686de> Whether a business is driven by the pursuit of long-term shared value or by short-term marketing gains fundamentally shapes the sustainability and depth of the partnership. A healthy social feedback mechanism serves as a critical incentive for companies to choose the former. <br data-v-2a1686de> 2.Trust Anchors the Three-Way Relationship <br data-v-2a1686de> Successful collaboration rests on a solid “triangle of trust”: the public must believe in the sincerity of the business; the business must trust in the transparency and professionalism of the nonprofit; and the nonprofit must safeguard its independent mission. Weakening any side of this triangle undermines the entire collaborative ecosystem. <br data-v-2a1686de> 3.Complementarity Over Substitution—Boundaries Matter <br data-v-2a1686de> Businesses bring resources, efficiency, and amplification; nonprofits contribute expertise and mission-driven focus. The most effective partnerships do not seek to replace one another, but rather to clearly define roles, leverage distinct strengths, and create mutually reinforcing value. </p></div></div></div><div class="research-section" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-container" data-v-2a1686de><div class="research-header" data-v-2a1686de><p class="research-title" data-v-2a1686de>VII. The Value of the Research and My Reflections</p><p class="research-description" data-v-2a1686de> This research represents my practical attempt, as a high school student, to understand a complex social reality through the lens of social science. <br data-v-2a1686de> Throughout the process, I gained not only data and conclusions but also a deeper conviction: effective public welfare is a systematically engineered endeavor. It requires thoughtful design, drawing not only on the goodwill inherent in human nature but also on rational planning and structural support within real-world systems. <br data-v-2a1686de> Admittedly, this study has its limitations. The cases examined are primarily concentrated in the field of medical assistance. Whether its findings can be extended to other areas—such as education or environmental protection—requires further investigation. Future research could expand to a wider range of cases and incorporate longer-term observation to paint a more complete and dynamic picture of “business for good.” <br data-v-2a1686de> For me, this is not simply the end of a paper, but a new beginning in my own engagement with social issues and my search for meaningful solutions. I hope these findings can offer a useful perspective for businesses and public welfare organizations committed to creating impact—so that every genuine intention can find its way, more effectively, to those who need it most. </p></div><div class="research-images" data-v-2a1686de><img loading="lazy" src="/smile/new/9.webp" alt="Gavin&#39;s Involvement" style="padding:0;" class="research-image" data-v-2a1686de></div></div></div>',7))])}],["__scopeId","data-v-2a1686de"]]);export{z as default};

Because hematopoietic tissues are among the most radiosensitive systems, even subtle damage may be detectable in peripheral blood measurements long before clinical disease becomes apparent. </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes are a sensitive biomarker for ionizing radiation effects and are widely used in biological dosimetry. Aberrations such as dicentric chromosomes, centric rings, and acentric fragments reflect DNA double-strand breaks and misrepaired chromosome ends, and can be scored in metaphase spreads using standardized criteria.  In China, CA testing has been incorporated into occupational health surveillance standards for radiation workers, supporting both baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring.  However, the prevalence of CAs and their associated risk factors can vary by workplace, task type, and duration of exposure, making institution-level evidence valuable for targeted prevention. </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> Against this background, the present study evaluates chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood immune cells among medical radiation diagnostics practitioners undergoing occupational medical examinations. The analysis includes 1,125 workers from a tertiary hospital in Guangdong Province, China, evaluated between January 2023 and December 2024.  By comparing hematologic indicators and CA outcomes across demographic and exposure-related subgroups, and by applying logistic regression modeling, the study aims to clarify whether age and cumulative exposure time are associated with increased chromosomal aberration risk, thereby providing practical evidence to strengthen occupational health surveillance and radiation protection strategies in medical settings. Such evidence is especially relevant for prioritizing long-tenured staff for intensified follow-up and preventive interventions. </p></div></section><section class="content-section section-gray" data-v-5c1997a2><h2 class="section-title" data-v-5c1997a2>Research Method</h2><div class="section-content" data-v-5c1997a2><h3 class="subsection-title" data-v-5c1997a2>Study design and participants：</h3><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> The study enrolled 1,125 medical radiation diagnostics practitioners who completed occupational health examinations at a tertiary hospital in Guangdong Province, China, between January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2024.  Participants were categorized into subgroups by gender, age, and length of service (radiation exposure duration) to support comparative analysis across demographic and exposure strata.  Recorded variables included age, gender, job category, and duration of occupational radiation exposure, along with routine hematology indices. </p><h3 class="subsection-title" data-v-5c1997a2>Chromosomal aberration assay：</h3><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> For each participant, 0.5 mL of peripheral venous blood was collected and cultured in 5 mL RPMI-1640 medium.

In univariate models, both age (OR=1.036) and exposure duration (OR=1.043) were significant, whereas gender and blood indices were not.  After adjustment for gender and hematologic covariates, exposure duration remained an independent risk factor: each additional year of occupational radiation exposure corresponded to a 3.9% increase in aberration risk (OR=1.039, 95% CI 1.013–1.067). </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> Biologically, these findings are consistent with ionizing radiation generating DNA double-strand breaks either directly or via free radicals from water radiolysis; imperfect repair through non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination can yield structural chromosome changes.  Age-related declines in repair capacity may further increase susceptibility to accumulated damage, providing a plausible mechanistic link between aging, longer service, and higher CA prevalence. </p></div></section><section class="content-section section-gray" data-v-5c1997a2><h2 class="section-title" data-v-5c1997a2>Conclusion</h2><div class="section-content" data-v-5c1997a2><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> This occupational health study provides institution-level evidence that long-term, low-dose ionizing radiation exposure in medical radiation diagnostics practice is associated with an increased prevalence of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood immune cells. Using standardized cytogenetic scoring criteria and routine occupational medical examination data from 1,125 workers assessed during 2023–2024, the study identified a measurable aberration burden in a minority of practitioners (5.8%), with affected individuals tending to be older and to have longer exposure duration than their non-aberrant peers.  </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> Critically, multivariate logistic regression showed that cumulative exposure duration remained an independent risk factor after adjustment for gender and blood indices: each additional year of occupational radiation exposure increased the odds of chromosomal aberrations by approximately 3.9% (OR=1.039, 95% CI 1.013–1.067).  This quantitative association supports the interpretation that chronic exposure contributes to accumulated DNA damage and misrepair, consistent with the mechanistic framework in which double-strand breaks and imperfect repair pathways generate dicentrics, rings, and fragments. </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> From a practical perspective, the findings argue for strengthening occupational health surveillance and radiation protection measures for medical radiation practitioners, with particular attention to workers with long service histories. The article specifically recommends reinforcing monitoring systems, improving protective equipment through customization and intelligent upgrades, and promoting remote/automated operational technologies to reduce exposure opportunities.  For higher-risk groups, shortening monitoring intervals and implementing supportive interventions were proposed as additional strategies. </p><p class="section-text" data-v-5c1997a2> While the study is informative for workplace management, it is based on examinations from a single tertiary hospital and focuses on exposure duration rather than individual dosimetry records. Future multi-center studies that integrate badge dose histories, task-specific exposure profiles, and longitudinal follow-up would help refine risk stratification and evaluate the impact of targeted protection policies over time. </p></div></section>',4)])])}],["__scopeId","data-v-5c1997a2"]]);export{o as default};

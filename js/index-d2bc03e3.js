The daily updates on infection rates, the widespread use of nucleic acid testing, and the urgent demand for vaccines and treatments led me to wonder: How does science respond to such a global public health challenge?

Despite progress in vaccination and treatment, the virus’s rapid evolution continues to challenge global health systems. The main protease (nsp5, or 3CL^pro^) is essential for viral replication and represents one of the most conserved and druggable targets in the coronavirus family. Inhibiting nsp5 effectively disrupts polyprotein processing, halting viral proliferation. Recent clinical inhibitors such as Nirmatrelvir and Ensitrelvir have shown promise, yet resistance mutations and limited cross-variant efficacy demand new strategies for identifying potent compounds. </p><div class="images-grid" data-v-c83e6d8f><div class="image-item" data-v-c83e6d8f><p class="section-text" style="margin-bottom:30px;" data-v-c83e6d8f> In this context, our project introduces an in-vivo FlipGFP-based nsp5 inhibitor screening system, a biosensor that converts protease activity into measurable fluorescence. By coupling the protease recognition motif with a re-foldable GFP split, we enable direct visualization of enzymatic activity and inhibition inside living cells. This modular design allows rapid substitution of protease-specific linkers, extending the platform’s utility to other viral targets. Our research also explores the potential of rationally engineered nsp5 variants with enhanced catalytic efficiency for use as a universal tag-cleaving enzyme in recombinant protein purification. Together, these advances aim to accelerate both antiviral discovery and biotechnological applications.</p><img src="/surfing/3.webp" alt="Research Diagram 1" data-v-c83e6d8f><p class="image-caption" style="padding-top:5px;" data-v-c83e6d8f>Figure 2.

After IPTG induction, the protein was isolated via Ni-NTA chromatography and characterized using FRET assays with a fluorogenic peptide substrate (MCA-AVLQSGFRK(DnP)K). Reaction kinetics were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation to obtain catalytic constants (k₍cat₎ and K₍m₎). <br data-v-c83e6d8f><br data-v-c83e6d8f> The FlipGFP reporter was implemented on a pRSF-Duet1 backbone, dividing β-strands 1-9 and 10-11 into separate ORFs. A specific nsp5 recognition sequence (AVLQ↓SFGRK) was inserted between β11 and K5 to control fluorescence restoration. Co-expression of FlipGFP and nsp5 in E. coli produced a fluorescence signal proportional to protease activity, which diminished upon inhibitor addition, establishing a quantitative screening assay. <br data-v-c83e6d8f><br data-v-c83e6d8f> Finally, guided by AlphaFold3 predictions, we introduced the T21I mutation to strengthen substrate binding. Mutant proteins were expressed and analyzed for kinetic improvement relative to wild type. </p><div class="images-grid" style="align-items:normal;" data-v-c83e6d8f><div class="image-item" style="width:640px;" data-v-c83e6d8f><img src="/surfing/7.webp" alt="Method Diagram 1" data-v-c83e6d8f><p class="image-caption" data-v-c83e6d8f>Figure 1.

When combined with the FlipGFP system, fluorescence intensity directly reflected protease cleavage efficiency, confirming the platform’s responsiveness and dynamic range. <br data-v-c83e6d8f><br data-v-c83e6d8f> Colonies expressing FlipGFP alone emitted no fluorescence, while those co-expressing nsp5 produced strong green emission—demonstrating precise control and low background noise. The introduction of inhibitors significantly reduced fluorescence, proving the system’s capability for real-time, cell-based inhibitor evaluation. <br data-v-c83e6d8f><br data-v-c83e6d8f> Moreover, the nsp5-T21I mutant exhibited a ~26% higher catalytic efficiency (k₍cat₎/K₍m₎ ≈ 3.5 × 10⁴ s⁻¹ M⁻¹), implying that subtle structural tuning can further enhance protease activity. This suggests broader application potential for engineered nsp5 variants as biotechnological tools, analogous to TEV or HRV 3C proteases but with superior kinetics. <br data-v-c83e6d8f><br data-v-c83e6d8f> The successful integration of biochemical assays with live-cell fluorescence imaging highlights FlipGFP’s versatility as a bridge between structural enzymology and functional screening. </p><div class="images-grid" style="align-items:normal;gap:110px;" data-v-c83e6d8f><div class="image-item" data-v-c83e6d8f><img src="/surfing/10.webp" alt="Discussion Result 1" data-v-c83e6d8f><p class="image-caption" data-v-c83e6d8f>Figure 1.

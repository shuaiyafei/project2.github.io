Using cooking as a central point, the film captures the intimate, lighthearted moments of a family of four as they navigate everyday life and generation of connection . The title, Between Walls and Steam, symbolizes the warmth, tension, and quiet love that unfold within the walls of a home, where rising steam from shared meals becomes a metaphor for memory, identity, and the invisible bonds that hold a family together. </p></div></div>',1)),o("div",l,[n(p,{src:f.videoSrc,poster:f.posterSrc,"video-duration":378},null,8,["src","poster"])]),a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"art-images"},[o("div",{class:"art-image-item"}),o("div",{class:"art-image-item"})],-1))])}],["__scopeId","data-v-efbb3127"]]);export{m as default};
